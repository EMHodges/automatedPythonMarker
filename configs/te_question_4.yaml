description: "The code for this question must be written in the provided file
      question_2.py.\r\nIn information theory, the Hamming distance between two strings
      of equal length is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols
      are different. In another words, it measures the minimum number of substitutions
      required to change one string into the other, or the minimum number of errors
      that could have transformed one string into the other. For example, the Hamming
      distance between:\r\n• \"karolin\" and \"kathrin\" is 3. • \"karolin\" and \"kerstin\"
      is 3. • 1011101 and 1001001 is 2.\r\nWrite a function hammingDistance(word1,
      word2) which takes two string parameters and returns the Hamming distance between
      the two strings word1 and word2. The function should raise a ValueError if the
      strings are not of the same length. In addition, the result must be case sensitive."
