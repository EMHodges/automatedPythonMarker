description: "Write a function <b>compute_score(record)</b> which takes a <b>str</b> containing the split times of an
athlete in each event. The function returns a tuple containing the name of the athlete, followed by the score for each
event, and finally the total score. The format of the <b>str record</b> file is as follow:
<ul>
  <li>
    Athlete's name,
  </li>
  <li>
    200m split time, that is the time recorded on the 200 metres race,
  </li>
  <li>
    110m split time,
  </li>
  <li>
    800m split time.
  </li>
</ul>
The fields are separated by a comma. The split time recorded in the file is in the format given in part i. The
method must raise a <b>ValueError</b> if the parameter <b>record</b> does not follow this format.
<div>
the returned tuple has the following format:
</div>
<br>
<div>
          <i>(Athlete_name, 200m_points, 110m_points, 800m_points, total_score)</i>
</div>
<br>
where <b>total_score</b> is the total score of the athlete (that is the sum of the points from the three events),
<b>200m_points</b>, <b>110m_points</b>, <b>800m_points</b> are the points for each event computed using the parameters
from the Table i part ii.
<div>
<br>
for example, given the record: <i>'Jessica ENNIS-HILL, 22.830, 12.540, 02:08:650'</i>
<br>
</div>
<div>
the returned value should be:   <i>('Jessica ENNIS-HILL', 1096, 1195, 984, 3275)</i>
</div>
<br>
<div>
<i>Note - you may use the <b>time_to_seconds(time)</b> & <b>track_points(time, event_parameters)</b> functions even if
your answers to part i and/or part ii was incorrect</i>
</div>
